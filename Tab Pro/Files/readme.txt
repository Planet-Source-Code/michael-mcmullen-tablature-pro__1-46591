1.0 What is Tablature Pro?

Tablature Pro is a small simple program where it can keep tracks of guitar/
bass/drum tabs in a single file downloaded from the internet. You can also
create your own Tablature Pro file with our tutorial.

3.0 Step-by-Step Guide

1) After Running the program, you can go to the File menu and select Open

2) You will now see a list of all files. Select your Tablature Pro file and click
	open. If this is not the correct file format you will get an error. A
	metallica tab has been provided so you can open that file to test the
	program.

3) Once you have a file open select a song from the song list. Then hit the Grab
	button.

4) Now you can scroll your tablature or print it off on a printer. Theres not
	much else you can do.

4.0 Using the Tablature Pro Editor

This is a fairly simple program. First when starting a new tab, use the file
menu and select New. Type in the name of the file you want to create.

Now start by adding your songs by clicking the [ADD] button. Once finished
double click on a song to start to add the tablature to that song. After
you are finished click the file menu and select save. Now once all done you
can view your finished tablature pro file with the Tablature Pro program.
